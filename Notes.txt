Angular Component Life Cycle Hooks:
- Whenever we execute the angular application it creates the component and updates it and finally it will destroy once if the compnentn is used in the application.
- All these phases of a component are maintaine by a sequence of events and these events are controllerd by methods and these methods are called "Hook Methods".

Hook Methods      
1) ngOnChanges()       
- Angular set the value, and also bind the value to any property.
- These updates are notified by using an object called "SimpleChanges".
- Will get previous values and also current values.

2) ngOnInit()
- It will be called after the first ngOnChnage() is happen.
- In this stage it will initilize all the directives of the components

3) ngDoCheck(): 
- It will be identifyy the every change in detection
- Transporting the data between the components, when we call @Input() and @Output()

4) ngAfterContentInit():
- To execute the dynemic content which was supplied by using <ng-container> and <ng-template> 

5) ngAfterContentChecked(): It is responsible for content projection.
6) ngAfterViewInit(): It used to fireup after the initilization of memory for component views and it's child views
7) ngAfterViewCheck():It renders the finel component
